Engine - 
* Compute shader
* Logging system (remove plog dependency)
* Debug logging system
* Look into timer improvements
* Input system improvements (to reduce input lag from DX11)
* Remove imageloader dependency (add headers to core)
* Look into adding SPIRV for automatic GLSL and HLSL shader conversion
* Integrated Render-to-quad FX system (Possibly apart of a CommandQueue system)

(Big tasks)
* Linux (X11) support
	* Compile with makefile
* Vulkan support
* GUI System
* Multithreading
